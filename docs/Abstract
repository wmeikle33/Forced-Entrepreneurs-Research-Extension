In this paper we replicate and extend “Forced Entrepreneurs” by Hacamo and Kleiner (2021). This paper documents that an unemployment shock increases entry into entrepreneurship. Furthermore, these firms are of higher quality compared with normal ones. In our extension, we gather data from graduates across 15 more countries, and apply a similar model to investigate the role of individualism from Hofstede’s framework. We find that medium levels of individualism are most strongly correlated with entry into entrepreneurship and firm success, while low and high levels of individualism are marginally positively correlated with entry into entrepreneurship and metrics of firm success.
